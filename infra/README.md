# Infrastructure

The infrastructure was created using `docker`, `terraform` and `AWS`.

## Frontend

To deploy the infrastructure remotely you can rely on `.github/workflows/deploy_frontend_infra.yml` (CI/CD with GitHub Actions). All secrets that are required during deployment are defined as GitHub Repository Secrets, therefore add the following GitHub Secret to the repository.

```bash
GH_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="TODO"
```

To deploy the infrastructure from your local machine, execute `make deploy-infra-frontend` (NOTE: Terraform variable inputs are defined in `infra/frontend/prod.tfvars`). You must set the following environment variables locally before deploying:

```bash
export TF_VAR_gh_personal_access_token="TODO"
```

## Backend

To deploy the infrastructure remotely you can rely on `.github/workflows/deploy_backend_infra.yml` (CI/CD with GitHub Actions). All secrets that are required during deployment are defined as GitHub Repository Secrets.

To deploy the infrastructure from your local machine, execute `make deploy-infra-backend` (NOTE: Terraform variable inputs are defined in `infra/backend/prod.tfvars`). You must set the following environment variables locally before deploying:

```bash
export TF_VAR_secret_key="TODO"
export TF_VAR_sql_password="TODO"
```

To use an external `PostgreSQL` RDS database as the database instead of a `SQLite3` file-based database on the ECS Fargate Tasks, uncomment the RDS code in `rds.tf`, `ecs.tf`, and `outputs.tf` and change the `database_type` to `postgresql` in `prod.tfvars`. NOTE: A NAT Gateway is required for ECS/Fargate to work if it is not deployed in a public subnet with a public IP since it must pull the ECR image for the container.
